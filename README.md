**A Comparison of Census 2010 SF1 & Differentially Private Data in Oregon.**

To help researchers and data users assess the "fitness for use" of upcoming 2020 census data products produced using the Census Bureau's Disclosure Avoidance System based on differential privacy algorithms, the Bureau produced 2010 Census Demonstration Data Products, which were made public on October 19, 2019.

The intent of this study is to better understand the effects of differential privacy on census data by comparing multiple demographic variables at various geographic scales within the state of Oregon. Of particular focus are key demographic variables that inform population forecasting and housing and land use planning, including population per age group, average household size, and occupancy rate. Visualization of the differentially private data in direct comparison to the Census 2010 summary file data will bring greater awareness of the issues that result from injecting unnecessarily large amounts of noise into respondent information.

The geographic units of analysis include Oregon counties, places, Urban Growth Boundaries (UGB) of Oregon cities, and non-UGB county areas.

For analysis and reporting purposes, the project utilizes the R programming language and RStudio integrated development environment, R Markdown (USP522_DiffPrivOR.Rmd), R packages (tidyverse, tidycensus, sf, rgdal, tigris, readxl, writexl, plotly, htmlwidgets, xfun, and arcgisbinding), U.S. Census API, Alteryx, Esri ArcGIS, and Microsoft Excel.

The results of this study, including interactive visualizations, provide the Portland State University (PSU) Population Research Center (PRC) and other Oregon stakeholders with a primer to assess the effects of differential privacy on 2020 Census summary tables and demographic assumptions used to prepare population estimates, population forecasts, housing and land use policies, and other demographic data products.
